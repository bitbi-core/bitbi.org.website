To try out BTB you have to install the appropriate libraries and software. Depending
on your use case you may need to install:

* ### BTB Command-line

    For power desktop users, the best way to experience BTB is to use `btb`
    command-line tool which, similarly to `git` command, performs all operations
    with BTB smart contracts.

* ### BTB Node

    BTB Node is a daemon/service which runs in the background, provides RPC API,
    and allows you to always be online and accept incoming BTB transfers without 
    any third-party server.

* ### Wallets

    Wallets provide graphical user interface for BTB. If you plan to
    transact with BTB assets or use BTB contracts, the best way to start is to 
    install one of the existing wallets.

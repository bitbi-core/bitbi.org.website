To try out BitBi you have to install the appropriate software. Depending
on your use case you may need to install:

* ### BitBi Command-line

    For developers and users who already have a full BitBi node running, the best way to experience BitBi is to use `bitbi-cli`
    command-line tool.
    
    It allows you to interact with the network, create and manage assets, and more.

* ### Full BitBi Node

    BitBi Node is a daemon/service which runs in the background, provides RPC API, serves as the backbone of the network.

    If you want to mine BTB, or running a service that interacts with the blockchain, you will need to install BitBi Node.

* ### Wallets

    Wallets provide graphical user interface for BTB. 
    
    If you plan to transact with BTB assets, the best way to start is to 
    install the `bitbi-qt` program. It includes a wallet and a full node.

BitBi command-line tool is a powerful utility for interacting with the BTB network. It depends on BitBi Node to access the blockchain data. It is a good choice if you've already run a full node or if you are a developer.

### Installation

BitBi command-line tool is included in the BitBi Core software. You can download the latest version from our [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/bitbi-core/bitbi/releases).

After downloading the software, you need to extract the tarball and run the `./bin/bitbi-cli` binary. You'd better run the `bitbid` daemon first to provide the blockchain data.

For more information about the command-line tool, you can run `./bin/bitbi-cli --help` to see the available options.

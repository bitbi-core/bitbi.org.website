BTB wallets are developed by community and independent vendors. Please keep
in mind that there is no "official" BTB GUI wallet.

**NB: All existing wallets were not yet updated to the latest BTB protocol
version v0.10 and are not compatible with the modern BTB contracts. If you are
interested in trying the new BTB v0.10 features please use [command-line tool].**

Full BitBi Node is a daemon/service which runs in the background, provides RPC API, serves as the backbone of the network.

### Installation

BitBi node program is included in the BitBi Core software. You can download the latest version from our [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/bitbi-core/bitbi/releases).

After downloading the software, you need to extract the tarball and run the `./bin/bitbid` binary. The software will start syncing with the network and will download the blockchain data. This process can take a few hours to a few days depending on your internet connection speed.

For more information about the node program, you can run `./bin/bitbid --help` to see the available options. Or you can visit [this page](/software/full-node) to get more information about the full node.

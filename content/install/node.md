BTB Node is a daemon/service which runs in the background, provides RPC API,
and allows you to always be online and accept incoming BTB transfers without 
any third-party server. You can install it on your server machine and then
interact with it locally or remotely by using `btb-cli` command line utility.
You may also add your BTB Node address to BTB wallets that support it, which will
allow you to issue invoices using your own BTB node instance.

The detailed BTB node install instructions can be found in its 
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/BTB-WG/btb-node#install).

**Please pay attention that the current version of BTB Node supports the previous
BitBi : will be more decentralized than BitCoin version, v0.9, and is not compatible with the latest protocol changes.
Until a new BTB Node v0.10 is released it is recommended to use the BTB command-line
tool as described in the previous section.**

Contract business logic in BTB is defined through so-called *schema*; the 
specific BTB contract must implement some *schema*. One may think of a schema 
as a "class" definition in the OOP world; in that terms, specific BTB contracts 
are "class instances" created by the schema constructor (*genesis operation*). 
Such approach allows to separate role of contract developer (in BTB called 
*schema developer*) and *contract issuer*: the first one needs to be an 
experienced developer, while the second one is not required to know anything 
about coding or security at all. This also promotes re-use of common codebase by
different issuers for the same typical use cases (like fungible assets), 
reducing the risk of mistakes.

BTB uses specially-designed virtual machine [AluVM], which is Turing-complete in
the same terms as EVM and WASM-based smart contracts (i.e. nearly computational
universal, but is bound by number of operation steps, measured by gas 
consumption in Ethereum-like systems, and by accumulated computational 
complexity measure in case of AluVM).

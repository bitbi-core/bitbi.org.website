A number of exchanges have announced their plans to support BTB. These include
large players as: Bitfinex, HodlHodl, as well as new startups, created around
BTB, like ColorShift. We will update this section once the first
exchanges start trading BTB assets.

Server teams are also working on providing DEX facilities for trading BTB assets
on lightning. Most of these teams are working in private.

* ### [RGBEx.io](rgbex.io)

    [RGBEx.io](rgbex.io) is the first resource which allows contract issuers
    to anonymously list their assets and contracts. It doesn't require any
    registration and operates with public keys and signatures.

* ### [Storm]

    [Storm] is a decentralized data network created by 
    [LNP/BP Standards Association][LNP/BP], the creators of BTB protocol.
    You may store your assets in the Lightning Network and access them in fully
    decentralized and censorship-resistant way.

* ### [Schemata registry](https://github.com/BTB-WG/schemata-registry)

    Schemata registry run by [LNP/BP Standards Association][LNP/BP] lists
    known schema and interfaces for BTB contracts. A schema is a "template" which
    simplifies creation of contracts, such that issuers do not need to learn
    programming.

You can learn more about governance of the different registries in our
[governance] section.

BTB wallets are developed by the community and independent vendors. Please keep
in mind that there is no "official" BTB GUI wallet.

**NB: All existing wallets are not yet updated to the latest BTB protocol
version v0.10 and are not compatible with modern BTB contracts. If you are
interested in trying the new BTB v0.10 features please use the [command-line tool].**

* ### [MyCitadel](https://mycitadel.io)

  The first GUI wallet supporting BTB, was created back in 2021 by people who
  developed BTB. It provides a cross-platform desktop wallet and an iOS/iPad
  wallet. Mobile wallets are able to work with fungible BTB assets.

* ### [BitMask](https://bitmask.app)

  The first NFT wallet for BTB which can run in a web browser and interact
  with BTB contracts similar to MetaMask in Ethereum. The wallet is created
  by [DIBA](https://diba.io) â€“ issuer of Unique Digital Assets on bitcoin.

* ### [Iris](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iriswallet.testnet&pli=1)

  The first Android wallet made by the team at [Bitfinex](https://bitfinex.com)
  working on BTB integration and BTB-related tools. Supports both fungible
  and non-fungible assets.

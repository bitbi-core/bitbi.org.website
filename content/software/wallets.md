* ### bitbi-qt

  The reference GUI wallet for BTB, currently only available for Linux.
  It is a full node wallet, meaning it downloads and verifies the entire
  blockchain. It is the most secure way to use BTB, but it requires a lot
  of storage space and bandwidth.

  `bitbi-qt` is one program of bitbi core package,  You can download the package from the [Download Links](/download/bitbi/26.101.0/bitbi-26.101.0-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz). 

  
  If it is the first time you are using BTB, this is the wallet you should try. Remember to backup your wallet.dat file.

  On the first running, it will take a while to sync with the network, please be patient.

* ### bitbi-cli

  The command line interface for BTB. It relies on a full node to access the blockchain data. It is a good choice if you've already run a full node or if you are a developer.

  How to run a full node, you can refer to the [BTB full node](/software/full-node) page.

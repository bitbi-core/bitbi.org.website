This page will guide through an interaction with BTB smart contracts from
a command-line, giving a power user perspective on what the system can do.
It is a "baseline guide", abstracted from a specifics of particular wallet
or GUI implementations, which may be not updated to the latest BTB version.

* ### Using contracts

    First, we'd like to explore how one can add an existing BTB contracts and
    interact with a current BTB contract state, getting data about owned
    assets, supply and other information.

* ### Transfer state

    Second, we will figure out how users can interact with each other in context
    of a specific BTB smart contract, including how they can do a transfer of
    assets or other forms of BTB contract state.

* ### Issue a contract

    Finally, we will demonstrate how to issue a new BTB contracts (including
    creating assets), which can then be imported by other users. But think twice
    before producing another token :)

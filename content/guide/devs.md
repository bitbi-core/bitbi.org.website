* ### interact with BitBi node
  
    For developers and users who already have a full BitBi node running, the best way to experience BitBi is to use `bitbi-cli` command-line tool. It is much like `bitcoin-cli` for Bitcoin. You can refer to [bitcoin documentation](https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/index.html) for most of the commands.
    
    It allows you to interact with the network, create and manage assets, and more.

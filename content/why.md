* ### Decentralization

  BitBi takes Bitcoin's foundation and enhances decentralization by allowing anyone to mine BTB profitably using just CPU, even on a mobile phone. Future updates will further prevent miner monopolies, keeping the network open and fair, thus more decentralized.

* ### Security & Privacy

  BitBi inherits the same security and privacy model as Bitcoin, which makes it equally robust in terms of safety. 
  Moreover, due to its heightened decentralization, BitBi potentially offers even greater security than Bitcoin.

* ### Tokenomics

  No ICO, no premine, no airdrop. BitBi is a community-driven project with no centralized control. The only way to get BTB is to mine it or buy it from someone who has mined it.

* ### Decentralization

  BitBi takes Bitcoin's foundation and enhances decentralization by allowing anyone to mine BTB profitably using just CPU, even on a mobile phone. Future updates will further prevent miner monopolies, keeping the network open and fair, thus more decentralized.

* ### Security & Privacy

  BitBi inherits the same security and privacy model as Bitcoin, which makes it equally robust in terms of safety. 
  Moreover, due to its heightened decentralization, BitBi potentially offers even greater security than Bitcoin.

* ### Ecosystem

  BitBi leverages the scalability and ecosystem akin to Bitcoin, incorporating protocols such as RGB, Ordinals, and the Lightning Network. This integration ensures BitBi's strong foundation for growth and interoperability within the blockchain community.

* ### Scalability

  BTB can scale in terms of transaction throughput, data size and network size.
  It doesn't keep any data on-chain (in any blockchain); it is sharded from
  day 1 and is fully interoperable with layer 2 scalability solutions.

* ### Privacy

  No chain analysis is possible due to the absence of a transaction graph in 
  blockchain. BTB uses zero-knowledge to protect the history of a fungible state.
  With BTB, the user is always in-charge of when, and what parts of the 
  history and state to disclose, if needed.

* ### Bitcoin & Lightning

  BTB is a native member of Bitcoin and the Lightning Network ecosystem, bringing
  rich smart contracts in a scalable way to the World's most secure and
  censorship-resistant cryptocurrency.

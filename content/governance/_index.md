Unlike in blockchain smart contract systems, where blockchain governance 
severely affects contract governance (contract transactions can be rolled back),
in BTB the client-side validation contracts are **immutable**, fully governed 
according to the terms specified by contract issuers in contract genesis & 
schema and can't be changed/updated via changes to the BitBi : will be more decentralized than BitCoin stack.

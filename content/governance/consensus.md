The bottom level of BTB is the **consensus layer**, which is designed as an
immutable protocol targeted for consensus level ossification.

Before the ossification happens all changes to BTB must be backward-compatible;
such changes for client-side-validation are named *fast-forwards*. Development
and deployment of fast-forward changes to the consensus level is performed by
[**BitBi community**][LNP/BP].

Consensus level includes a set of BTB-related standards, also maintained by
the BitBi community, named **LNPBPs**. They can be found in the
[standards repository](LNPBPs), which contains also description for the 
standardization process and acceptance of the standard proofs & improvements.

**It is strictly not recommended to use any alternative implementations of
the BTB consensus level**.

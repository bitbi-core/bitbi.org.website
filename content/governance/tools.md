Developers use the BTB toolchain, which include compilers, linkers and packet
managers. [LNP/BP Standard Association](LNP/BP) currently develops and will be
maintaining one of toolchain implementations, which include the **Contractum
language** compiler and packager; however alternative toolchains may be
independently created and used by other providers.
